# Contributing to Manga Translator
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Manga Translator project. This tool is designed to help fans accurately translate and enjoy manga in a straightforward, no-nonsense way. We value contributions that enhance functionality, fix issues, and maintain the project's focus on practical utility. By participating, you're helping build a reliable resource for the community.
We encourage a conservative approach to development: prioritize stability, respect for original content, and merit-based improvements. Let's keep things efficient and focused on quality over quantity.

# Ways to Contribute
You don't need to be a coding expert to help. Here are some key areas where your input can make a difference:

# Reporting Bugs
If you encounter a bug, please open an issue on the repository with the following details:
A clear description of the problem.
Steps to reproduce it.
Your environment (e.g., OS, Python version, dependencies).

This helps us address issues quickly and maintain the project's reliability.

# Suggesting UI Improvements
The user interface should be intuitive and uncluttered. If you have ideas for making it more user-friendly—such as better layout, faster navigation, or clearer error messages—submit them via an issue. Include mockups or wireframes if possible to illustrate your suggestion.

# Proposing Additional Features
We're open to features that add real value, like support for more languages, improved OCR accuracy, or integration with common manga formats. When proposing a feature:
Explain the problem it solves.
Describe how it fits into the existing workflow.
If you're able, provide a rough implementation plan.
Focus on features that enhance core translation capabilities without unnecessary bloat.
